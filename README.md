# Handwritten-Alphabet-Recognition-CNN
We recognize handwritten characters(English alphabets) from A-Z by modeling a Convolutional Neural Network that will be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets. Using Numpy, openCV, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib and Pandas. The dataset for this project contains 372450 images of alphabets of 28Ã—2, all present in the form of a CSV file: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format">Handwritten character recognition dataset</a>
